# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Let's be honest, most people check social media to see cute animals. Why not normalize pet-only profiles with Petbook? With Petbook, you can now create a standalone profile for your furry friends and share updates on your timeline about them. As someone who runs an Instagram account dedicated to her dogs, I'd love to have a service that is strictly there for pet updates just like Petbook.
### Features
1. User login: Users can create an account and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
2. User search: Users will be able to search for other users.
3. Create post: Users will be able to create new posts that will appear on the profile.
4. Feed of posts: A live feed of posts will be curated from users.
5. Interact with posts: Users can interact with posts with actions such as "sniffing" or "tail wagging"
### Technologies
Node.js
React.js
Next.js
### What I'll Have to Learn
This project is outside the scope of my everyday work as a QA Analyst at PayIt LLC. At work I deal with a lot of web-based applications however none that match the format of a social media browser. I also have little to no experience with React and would like to use it more so that is why I chose this language to complete my project.
